      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This page examines usability problems with an existing interface, Vote Smart, and proposes an improved redesign for the page.</p>

        <h2>Interface Description and Problems</h2>
        <h3>Why I chose this website:</h3>
        <p> I chose this website because I interned at this organization, so I used the website frequently, and I was frustrated with some of the design issues and thought it would be interesting to try to fix the problems.
        </p>

          <p>Vote Smart is a website where users can search for information about United States politicians. 
            The website collects biographical information, speeches, every vote on a bill (if applicable), 
            and ratings of the politicians from special interest groups. It is billed as a one-stop-shop for unbiased, factual information for voters. </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>WAVE found 27 errors with the site. Most (18) were missing alt text or form labels. These errors are especially bad because the whole site is basically one big search form with pictures, so missing labels for those items makes the service useless. WAVE also found empty buttons and links. Empty buttons or links are bad for everyone because a user clicks a button or link expecting it to do something, and it doesnâ€™t match our conceptual model when nothing happens. Overall, I agree with these findings, and this type of counterintuitive design is why I chose this application for my project.

        <p>I redesigned the website using HTML and CSS. The redesigned page addresses the usability problems that I identified.</p>
